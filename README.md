# Bug-Tracking-System
Bug Tracking System is the application is implemented on Java platform is designed to track the status of bugs that are reported during Software testing.

.........EXISTING SYSTEM :
The bugs that are identified by tester in software testing phase are reported to Project Manager and 
developer through simple shared lists and emails. Most of the companies share this information 
through document called “Defect report”. This procedure is error prone and there is ample chance 
of leaving some bugs unfixed and ignored as there is no particular tracking system in place. The 
team involved in the software development life cycle must be aware of the status of each and every 
bug reported. The existing system fails to fulfill this requirement thus it affects productivity and 
accountability of every member of team.

..........PROPOSED SYSTEM :
Bug tracking system is essentially and effectively implemented to monitor the status of bugs in an 
application. All the bugs that are identified are stored in a database. Each bug is assigned with an 
unique bug id and respective status of bug. Bugs can be created and updated with ease. Specific 
user accounts to control the access and maintain security are incorporated into the application. 
Bug tracking system which is implemented on Java provides an overview on standards of coding 
of the developers involved. Employee accountability can be tracked and analyzed on daily basis by 
using report generation option.
This web-based business application is a great tool for assigning and tracking issues and tasks 
during software development and any other projects that involve teams of two or more people.
